Pinecone is a vector database platform designed for handling large-scale vector search and similarity search applications, leveraging machine learning models. The Pinecone Airflow provider offers modules to easily integrate Pinecone with Airflow.

In this tutorial you'll use Airflow to create vectors out of movie descriptions using Sci-kit learn, create an index within Pinecone, upload those vectors into your index, and query the uploaded vectors with a movie ID to find similar movies!
